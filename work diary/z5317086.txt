Week 1
Group formed. I created the Jira & GitHub accounts. Together with John Smith, I wrote the user story and sprints section of the proposal. I also found and discussed with the team all available software tools and libraries that we can use for the project.
Week 2
I wrote the first version of hello.c, api.h, api.c and drafted a design for the Web service API between the client and the server â€“ all by myself.

You should also include in this diary the following information (if applicable) about the project progress:
- what was planned for the period since the last work diary entry
- what was finished
- what were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome (or what was tried and did not work)
- what was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered
- what is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)
