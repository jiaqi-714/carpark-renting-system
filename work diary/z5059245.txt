Week 1

Group was formed. Roles were assigned. We decided our project (Car Space Renting System) and discussed what tools we might use. We also decided on a rough time for a weekly meeting.

Week 2

I was sick for all of this week. I thoroughly explored one of the existing websites (parkhound) to check out all their features as well as making an account and creating a dummy car space listing.

I also started on the user stories. The group then roughly finished the rest. 

During our meeting on Saturday, we finished the user stories and settled on a lot of planning decisions (e.g. sprint structure).

Plans for next week: Finish proposal by next friday. Start coding by roughly next Friday.

Week 3

I drafted a sql database schema for our project.
We finalised a lot of user flow stuff during our group meeting. I also worked on some of the acceptance criteria as well as various parts of the Proposal document.

Proposal was completed Sunday night 19/06/22

Week 4
 
Wrote flask server with basic routes but no logic yet.

Week 5

Caught COVID and wasn't able to work that much. 

Added some stuff in car_spaces.py and fixed some bugs to get the listing routes working properly.

Added token verification which lets us get the userID from the token in the http request header.

Week 7

Added basic review stuff.

Week 8

Added a lot of user related functionality and permission checking.

Week 9

Fixed a lot of database access stuff which was previously hardcoded. Password strength checking added. Made randomly generated booking numbers.

Week 10

Added an easy way to update a row in database with a partial dictionary. Fixed a lot of booking and user stuff.
